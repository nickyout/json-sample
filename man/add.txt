Usage:  json-sample add <name> <url> [-m|--description=<str>] [--tags=<tag>,<tag>] [-f|--force]
        json-sample add [-f|--force]

Description: json-sample add <name> <url> [...options]

    Add a new JSON sample to your local registry. The file will be downloaded, 'validated' as JSON
    and some meta-data will be extracted. If all goes well, a new entry is added to your registry.
    If the specified <name> and the <url> is already present in the repository, it will reject the addition.

Description: json-sample add [-f|--force]

    Pass no <name> or <url> to trigger a series of prompts that will guide you through the arguments.
    The option to overwrite (--force) will not be provided interactively, but you can still
    specify it as a command option.

Options:

  -f, --force               the JSON sample is added even if it means overwriting an existing JSON sample.
  -m, --description=<str>   Add this description to the entry.
      --tags=<tag>,<tag>    Include these tags with the entry. Separate each new tag with a comma or space.
