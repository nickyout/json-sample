Usage:  json-sample add <name> <url> [--tags=<tag>,<tag>] [--force|-f]

Description:

    Add a new JSON sample to your local registry. The file will be downloaded, 'validated' as JSON
    and some meta-data will be extracted. If all goes well, a new entry is added to your registry.
    If the specified <name> and the <url> is already present in the repository, it will reject the addition.

Options:

  -f, --force               the JSON sample is added even if it means overwriting an existing JSON sample.
      --tags=<tag>,<tag>    Include these tags with the entry. Separate each new tag with a comma.
