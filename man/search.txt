                           [--date=<hr>][--tags=<tag>,<tag>]

Description:

    Search for particular samples, using a range of filtering options.
    A specified name is used as substring sequence to match to sample names, and is case-insensitive.
    A boolean option's effect can be inverted by prefixing its name with "no-". All range options
    use their values as 'at least'. Prefix the value with '-' to make them work as 'at most'.
    Each option can only be used once.

Options:

      --bytes=<hr>          a sample must at least be this big. Accepts human-readable ('1MB').
      --max-depth=<n>       a sample must at least have this recursion depth.
      --homogenity=<n>      a sample must have at least this factor of homogenity.
                            Higher means that (relatively) more objects share the same keys,
      --booleans=<n>        a sample must at least have this many booleans
      --strings=<n>         a sample must at least have this many strings
      --numbers=<n>         a sample must at least have this many numbers
      --arrays=<n>          a sample must at least have this many arrays
      --objects=<n>         a sample must at least have this many objects
      --nulls=<n>           a sample must at least have this many nulls
      --[no-]special-chars  a sample must have (no) special chars in its strings or keys.
      --[no-]exponential    a sample must have (no) exponentials among its numbers
      --[no-]float          a sample must have (no) floats among its numbers
      --[no-]negative       a sample must have (no) negative numbers among its numbers
      --date=<hr>           a sample must added at this date or later. Accepts human-readable ('yesterday').
      --tags=<tag>,<tag>    each tag must be present for a sample to pass
