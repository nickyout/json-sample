Usage:  json-sample install
        json-sample install <name> <path> [--save]

Description: json-sample install

    Downloads all samples as dictated in the local json-samples.json file,
    and saves them to their respective paths. If a destination file already exists (even if it is
    not the same file), the sample will be omitted. If there are remotes in the json-samples.json file
    that are not known locally, these remotes will be downloaded and their samples will take precedence
    over the locally known samples.

Description: json-sample install <name> <path> [--save]

    Downloads a single sample <name> from the registry and saves it to destination <path>.
    If a file already exists on <path> (even if it is not the same file), it will be omitted.
    Any remotes mentioned in the json-samples.json file will not be downloaded.

Options:

      --save                store the reference to the local json-samples.json file
