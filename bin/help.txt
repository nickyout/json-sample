Methods:
    init
        Creates a new json-samples.json file in the current directory. It will have all remote registries
        listed in your local registry, and no specified samples.

    install
        Installs all samples as dictated in the json-samples.json file in the current directory.

    search [<name>] [...options]
        Search for particular samples, using a range of filtering options.
        A specified name is used as substring sequence to match to sample names, and is case-insensitive.
        All range options use their values as 'at least'. Prefix with '-' to make them work as 'at most'.
        Each option can only be used once.

        --bytes=<hr>        a sample must at least be this big. Accepts human-readable ('1MB').
        --max-depth=<n>     a sample must at least have this recursion depth.
        --homogenity=<n>    a sample must have at least this factor of homogenity.
                            Higher means that (relatively) more objects share the same keys,
        --booleans=<n>      a sample must at least have this many booleans
        --strings=<n>       a sample must at least have this many strings
        --numbers=<n>       a sample must at least have this many numbers
        --arrays=<n>        a sample must at least have this many arrays
        --objects=<n>       a sample must at least have this many objects
        --nulls=<n>         a sample must at least have this many nulls
        --special-chars     a sample must have special chars in its strings or keys
        --exponential       a sample must have exponentials among its numbers
        --float             a sample must have floats among its numbers
        --negative          a sample must have negative numbers
        --date=<hr>         a sample must added at this date or later. Accepts human-readable ('yesterday').
        --tags=<tag>,<tag>  each tag must be present for a sample to pass

    sync [--force|-f]
        Retrieve new samples for all remote registries referred to in the (local) registry.
        By default, your local registry is considered to be 'the truth' and will be leading when
        inconsistencies are found between your own and a remote.

        --force             when finding inconsistencies, the remote registries are considered the truth.

    add <name> <url> [--tags=<tag>,<tag>] [--force|-f]
        Add a new JSON sample to your local registry. The file will be downloaded, 'validated' as JSON
        and some meta-data will be extracted. If all goes well, a new entry is added to your registry.
        If the specified <name> and the <url> is already present in the repository, it will reject the addition.

        --force             the JSON sample is added even if it means overwriting an existing JSON sample.
        --tags=<tag>,<tag>  Include these tags with the entry.

Options:
    --help|-h
        Shows this message.
