Usage:  json-sample <command> [<args>]
        json-sample init
        json-sample install
        json-sample search
        json-sample sync [--force|-f]
        json-sample add <name> <url> [--tags=<tag>,<tag>] [--force|-f]

Methods:
    init
        Creates a new json-samples.json file in the current directory. It will have all remote registries
        listed in your local registry, and no specified samples.

    install
        Installs all samples as dictated in the json-samples.json file in the current directory.

    search
        Search for particular samples.

    sync [--force|-f]
        Retrieve new samples for all remote registries referred to in the (local) registry.
        By default, your local registry is considered to be 'the truth' and will be leading when
        inconsistencies are found between your own and a remote.

        With --force, when finding inconsistencies, the remote registries are considered the truth.

    add <name> <url> [--tags=<tag>,<tag>] [--force|-f]
        Add a new JSON sample to your local registry. The file will be downloaded, 'validated' as JSON
        and some meta-data will be extracted. If all goes well, a new entry is added to your registry.
        If the specified <name> and the <url> is already present in the repository, it will reject the addition.

        With --force, the JSON sample is added even if it means overwriting an existing JSON sample.
        With --tags=<tag>,<tag> (repeating) you can add tags to the entry.
